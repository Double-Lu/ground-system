# agenda

## Progress since last meeting

* Qt commanding a Gazebo model over TCP connection
* Basic object recognition project built and run
* Qt streaming data from Gazebo over UDP connection instead of turtle
* Animated gauges reacting to Gazebo data stream

## Tasks to complete before next meeting

### Command/Control

* Navigation in Gazebo - find FOSS library or design custom algorithm
* Populate world with models

### Machine Health

* Better layouts for gauges
* Gauge connected to sensor in Gazebo (not position-vector)

### Camera

* Implement and continue to learn about object detection
* Add controls to UI for overlays

### Our Goals

#### Primary goal
Leave a path forward for implementations and extensions for all desired features


#### Minimum devliverables
Implement at least one example of:
* a sensor-driven camera view
* a *meaningful* sensor-driven display widget
* command for a non-trivial mission (ie follow detected object)
* 



#### Ted's Email

* Wants machine learning in the plan
* EE to deliver Gazebo/real compenents in time for integration (or not)
